`View Completed PRODUCT REGISTRY Demo <TODO>`_


.. important ::

  In this exercise, youâ€™re going to get a crash course on the React library by building a simple product registry and voting application.
  
  You will become familiar with the fundamentals of React front-end development and be able to build an interactive React app from scratch!

----

Stage 1: Starting the Application
=======================================================

.. note::

  Begin instructions from within the VM(via VirtualBox) that was configured and run in `step 6 of the prerequisites <https://blg-dapp-fundamentals.readthedocs.io/en/blg-school-hack-4-change/course-content/prerequisites/general.html#start-the-vm>`_.

`Video Tutorial [1-2] <todo>`_

Open a new terminal window
-----------------------------

  - Click on the terminal icon in the left dock

Start the app
-----------------

  - Change directory into the ``blg/product-registry-01`` folder on the Desktop
    
    .. code-block:: bash

      cd Desktop/blg/product-registry-01

  - Start the server
    
    .. code-block:: bash

      npm start

  - *Example output:*

    .. code-block:: console

      ajl@x1c:~/Desktop/blg/product-registry-01$ npm start

      > product-registry-01@1.0.0 start /home/ajl/Desktop/blg/product-registry-01
      > live-server --host=localhost --port=3000 --middleware=./libraries/disable-browser-cache.js

      Serving "/home/ajl/Desktop/blg/product-registry-01" at http://localhost:3000 (http://127.0.0.1:3000)
      Ready for changes

  - Chrome should automatically be opened and the application rendered!  Otherwise navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.  
    You should see some basic text and your first task!

Stage 2: Understanding and Updating the Application
=======================================================

Open the application's code in the Sublime text editor
---------------------------------------------------------
- Open the Sublime text editor by clicking on the Sublime icon in the left dock.

- From within Sublime open the `product-registry-01` folder. 
- Click on ``File`` in the top left corner and select ``Open Folder...`` in the menu.  
- Select ``Desktop/blg/product-registry-01`` to open, and we can get to coding!

Open up the ``index.html`` file within the ``product-registry-01`` folder
------------------------------------------------------

  - View the contents of the file
  - Update the header ``<h1></h1>`` where your first task is noted
  - Update the header to be **your** Product registry, for example ``Adam's Product Registry``

  - Example Code:

    .. code-block:: html

      <h1 class="ui dividing centered header">Adam's Product Registry</h1>

  - Save the file!  This may be done by selecting the File menu in the top left corner and selecting save, or with the keyboard shortcut ``ctrl + s```
  - View the updated title in the browser!

Reverting to a Blank ``app.js`` file to get started!
----------------------------------------------------
  
  - Note within the open ``index.html`` file that ``app-complete.js`` is linked in a ``<script>`` tag within the ``<body>``
  - Update this to link ``app.js`` instead of ``app-complete.js``, which is the blank template you will begin with
  - Don't forget to save!

  - Example Code:

    .. code-block:: html

      <script
        type="text/babel"
        data-plugins="transform-class-properties"
        src="app.js"
      ></script>
