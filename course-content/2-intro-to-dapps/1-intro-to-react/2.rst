2. Understanding and Updating the Application
=======================================================

Open the application's code in the Sublime text editor
---------------------------------------------------------
- Open the Sublime text editor by clicking on the Sublime icon in the left dock.

- From within Sublime open the `product-registry-01` folder. 
- Click on ``File`` in the top left corner and select ``Open Folder...`` in the menu.  
- Select ``Desktop/blg/product-registry-01`` to open, and we can get to coding!

Open up the ``index.html`` file within the ``product-registry-01`` folder
------------------------------------------------------

  - View the contents of the file. 
  - Don't worry too much about what is being *linked* within the ``<head>`` of the file, the core to focus on is between the ``<body></body>`` tags beneath
  - The core of the application may be simplified to the following:

    .. code-block:: html

      <div>
        <h1>Welcome! Your first task, CHANGE ME :)</h1>
        <div id="content"></div>
      </div>
    
    - Simply a title ``<h1>`` and one ``<div>`` that contains the *content* of the application.  Remember this *content* ``<div>`` as we will see it again soon!

  - Update the title ``<h1></h1>`` where your first task is noted
  - Update the title to be **your** Product registry, for example ``Adam's Product Registry``

  - Example Code:

    .. code-block:: html

      <h1 class="ui dividing centered header">Adam's Product Registry</h1>

  - Save the file!  This may be done by selecting the File menu in the top left corner and selecting save, or with the keyboard shortcut ``ctrl + s```
  - View the updated title in the browser!

Reverting to a Blank ``app.js`` file to get started!
----------------------------------------------------
  
  - Note within the open ``index.html`` file that ``app-complete.js`` is linked in a ``<script>`` tag within the ``<body>``
  - Update this to link ``app.js`` instead of ``app-complete.js``, which is the blank template you will begin with.
  - Don't forget to save!

  - Example Code:

    .. code-block:: html

      <script
        type="text/babel"
        data-plugins="transform-class-properties"
        src="app.js"
      ></script>
