1. Starting the Application
=======================================================

.. note::

  Begin instructions from within the VM(via VirtualBox) that was configured and run in `step 6 of the prerequisites <../0-prerequisites/0-index.html>`_.

Open a new terminal window
-----------------------------

  - Click on the terminal icon in the left dock

Start the app
-----------------

  - Change directory into the ``blg/product-registry-01`` folder on the Desktop
    
    .. code-block:: bash

      cd Desktop/blg/product-registry-01

  - Start the server
    
    .. code-block:: bash

      npm start

  - *Example output:*

    .. code-block:: console

      ajl@x1c:~/Desktop/blg/product-registry-01$ npm start

      > product-registry-01@1.0.0 start /home/ajl/Desktop/blg/product-registry-01
      > live-server --host=localhost --port=3000 --middleware=./libraries/disable-browser-cache.js

      Serving "/home/ajl/Desktop/blg/product-registry-01" at http://localhost:3000 (http://127.0.0.1:3000)
      Ready for changes

  - Chrome should automatically be opened and the application rendered!  Otherwise navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.  
    You should see some basic text and your first task!

  .. note::

    The ``npm start`` command that you executed ran the ``start`` script in the included ``package.json`` file:
    
    .. code-block:: json

      {
        [...],
        "scripts": {
          "start": "live-server --host=localhost --port=3000 --middleware=./libraries/disable-browser-cache.js"
        },
        "devDependencies": {
          "live-server": "https://github.com/acco/live-server/tarball/master"
        }
      }
    
    This ran a very light-weight server that will host the code for your browser to access.
    The server will also detect changes in the code base and automatically re-render the browser.  
    Therefore you will not need to restart the server at all during development and every time that 
    you change and save a file the browser will render the updated page for you.
