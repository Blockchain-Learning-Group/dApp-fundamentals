*Atom will be used through-out. and thus is recommended but not required. A text editor with solidity support is advised however.*
1. Install the atom editor from: [Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/)
- Other options: [Available Solidity Integrations](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#available-solidity-integrations)

2. Install atom's solidity plug-in [Etheratom](https://atom.io/packages/etheratom)
- Within atom along the top bar select Packages => Settings View => Manage Packages
- Select install in the left naviation bar and search for etheratom
- The correct packages should have ~3k downloads

- Version > 55.0.0.  Check in address bar: `chrome://version/`

*In the rare case where your machine is constrained to an older version of chrome and therefore metamask will not work, proceed with this dockerized chrome local environment setup: [local-dockerized-chrome-env](https://github.com/Blockchain-Learning-Group/dapp-fundamentals/blob/master/course-content/prerequisites/local-dockerized-chrome-env.md)*

### 3.3 Metamask
1. Install the chrome plugin, Metamask from: [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)

### 3.4 Development Dependencies

__Follow ONLY 1 option below__

1. [__[Recommended]__ Local Docker Environment](https://github.com/Blockchain-Learning-Group/dapp-fundamentals/blob/master/course-content/prerequisites/local-docker-env.md)

*Note all examples and video tutorials will utilize this environment.*
  - Development will be conducted within a docker container(virtual environment) booted from a blg provided image.
  - Chrome will be installed on the local machine and will interact with the application running inside the container.

2. [Local Environment](https://github.com/Blockchain-Learning-Group/dapp-fundamentals/blob/master/course-content/prerequisites/local-env.md)

*If you wish to run everything locally and are familiar with installing packages via package managers such as npm and apt-get then the following may be for you. Note that all course examples and video tutorials will NOT utilize this environment.*
- All development dependencies will be installed on the local machine.
- All development will conducted within the local machine's environment.
- Chrome will be installed on the local machine and will interact with the application running locally.

# 4.0 Ethereum Client

*BLG hosts a Kovan node that participants may interact with. Details to connect will follow via a secure channel. Note examples and video tutorials will make use of the remote node.*

- However, if you do wish to run a full ethereum node locally, NOT required, the steps to do so are here: [parity-local-install](https://github.com/Blockchain-Learning-Group/dapp-fundamentals/blob/master/course-content/prerequisites/parity-local-install.md)
